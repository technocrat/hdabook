Learning Haskell Data Analysis
==============================

Thanks for reading the book!

This collection of files contains every function
and every line of code presented in the book. If
something is unclear in the text, check the code
here. The introduction of each module contains, in
order, the lines of code presented in the book so
that you can copy and paste everything straight to
GHCi. Instructions on how to obtain the libraries
and other necessary programs are also included for
Debian systems.

The code presented in the book is formatted in a
manner so that it fits onto the page. The code
presented here is formatted to my style
preferences.

Update to Chapter 7
-------------------

I realize that I failed to include how to install
the necessary Haskell libraries for the code
presented in Chapter 7. Those instructions are
presented at the beginning of the file
LearningDataAnalysis07.hs.
